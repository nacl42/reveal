    "Some winter birds that I sketched up, they're so much fun to draw and
    I am very happy with how cute they came out.  From left to right:
    Blue Jay, cardinal, stellar jay, finch, chickadee, redpoll,
    nuthatch, sparrow, cedar waxwing."
  

# Birds

A set of 15 birds, in the LPC style. Includes some generic ones and specific species (eagle, sparrow, robin, bluejay, cardinal). Includes flying and walking animations in 4 directions for each bird. I was inspired by https://opengameart.org/content/winter-birds by Refuzzle (CC0) and used his colors for the cardinal (the LPC palette was just not red enough).
